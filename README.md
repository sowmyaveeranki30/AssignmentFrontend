# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

# Explanation of application on frontend

Frontend consists of all the actions required for this assignment.
This application consists data on four different types of batteries "Megapack2XL, Megapack2, Megapack, and Powerpack and Transformer" and their properties.
In this application if the customer selects a battery all the properties of that particular battery are displayed along with the "Cost", "Site Energy density", and "Land dimension required". 

To make the layout intuitive, images of the batteries and transformer are added along with their values per the grid given in the assignment. 
If the customer selects 4 batteries a pop message is shown that he needs a transformer.
If customers select batteries that exceed the site layout width by 100ft an error message is shown.
An autogenerated site layout is given for customer experience as per the choice of battery. The grid in the box resembles the battery according to its size. For example, Megapack2XL's floor dimension is 40FT * 10FT which is the highest in other batteries so the grid is sized accordingly.
The application is easy to use and shows all the details as per the given input.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:8000/](http://localhost:8000/) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
